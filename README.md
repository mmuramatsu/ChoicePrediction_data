# ChoicePredition database

In this repository we store all the data collected in the experiment carried out for the master's project "Prediction of choices based on heart rate variability", developed as part of the requirements for obtaining the Master's degree in Computer Science at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

The program used to collect the data for this project can be found at [Heart rate collector repository](https://github.com/mmuramatsu/Heart-rate-collector).
